# Dynamic image resizing with Ruby and Serverless framework

In this example, we set up a dynamic image resizing solution with AWS S3 and a Serverless framework function written in Ruby. We use [mini_magick gem](https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick) for image resizing.

## Pre-requisites

In order to deploy the function, you will need the following:

- API credentials for AWS with persmissions to manage S3, IAM and API Gateway
- Docker installed locally

## Deploying the Serverless project

1. Add your AWS credentials into `deploy.sh`
2. Deploy the Serverless project using docker:

```
docker build .
docker images
docker run <container-id>
```

## Example usage
